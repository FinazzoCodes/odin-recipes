    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 medium yellow onion</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper</li>
      <li>1 (24 to 25-ounce) jar marinara sauce</li>
      <li>12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>1 pound box of dry lasagna noodles</li>
      <li>15 to 16 ounces whole-milk ricotta cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Heat the oven to 400ºF. Arrange a rack in the middle of the oven and
        heat the oven to 400°F.
      </li>
      <li>
        Brown the beef and onion. Finely chop 1 medium yellow onion. Heat 1
        tablespoon olive oil in a 12-inch or larger regular or cast iron skillet
        over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add the onion, 1 pound lean
        ground beef, 1/2 teaspoon kosher salt, and 1/4 teaspoon freshly ground
        black pepper, and cook, breaking the beef up into small pieces with a
        wooden spoon, until the beef is cooked through, 6 to 8 minutes. Remove
        from the heat and let cool for 5 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Prepare the baking dish and assemble the meat sauce. Open 1 (24 to
        25-ounce) jar marinara sauce (3 cups). Spread a thin layer of the sauce
        in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Stir the remaining sauce into
        the ground beef mixture.
      </li>
      <li>
        Begin layering the lasagna. Shred 12 ounces low-moisture mozzarella
        cheese if needed (3 cups). Place 5 lasagna noodles in the baking dish,
        breaking them if needed to create a single layer (it’s OK if the noodles
        overlap slightly). Dollop and spread 1 cup of the ricotta cheese over
        the noodles. Dollop and spread about 1 1/2 cups of the meat sauce on the
        ricotta, then sprinkle with 1 cup of the mozzarella.
      </li>
      <li>
        Continue layering the lasagna. Arrange 5 more noodles over the
        mozzarella, followed by 1 cup of the ricotta cheese, 1 1/2 cups of the
        meat sauce, and 1 cup of the mozzarella. Top with a final layer of 5
        noodles and the remaining sauce, spreading the sauce thin so that it
        almost completely covers the noodles. (Reserve the remaining 1 cup
        mozzarella for the end of baking.) Cover the dish tightly with aluminum
        foil.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake the lasagna for 1 hour. Bake for 1 hour. Check to make sure the
        noodles are done by poking the lasagna with a knife; the knife should
        slide easily through all the layers. If it doesn't, cover and cook for
        15 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sprinkle with the remaining mozzarella and finish baking. Uncover the
        lasagna and sprinkle with the remaining 1 cup mozzarella. Bake uncovered
        until the mozzarella is melted and lightly browned, and the sauce is
        bubbling, 8 to 10 minutes more.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cool the lasagna for 15 minutes. Let the lasagna cool on a wire rack for
        at least 15 minutes before serving.
