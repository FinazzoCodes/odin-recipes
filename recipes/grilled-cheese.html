    <h1>How to make the Ultimate Grilled Cheese!</h1>

    <p>
      Get ready to savor the ultimate grilled cheese experience. Whether you
      choose classic white bread or opt for the delightful tang of sourdough,
      this recipe promises a crispy, golden exterior like no other. A thin layer
      of mayonnaise ensures a beautifully browned finish, while a touch of Dijon
      mustard adds a hint of tangy sophistication. Sizzle your sandwich in
      butter to perfection, and of course, don't forget the star of the show – a
      delectable combination of two cheeses that'll make your taste buds sing.
      Say hello to grilled cheese perfection!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Good bread – My preferred type of bread for this recipe is sourdough,
        because I love the tang it adds to the sandwich. I definitely recommend
        trying it out, but if you’re a grilled cheese purist, or if you don’t
        keep sourdough on hand, regular white bread will work here too.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mayonnaise – For the outside of the bread! It helps it cook up with a
        crisp, beautifully browned exterior.
      </li>
      <li>
        Dijon mustard – It’s not totally traditional, but it’s SO delicious,
        adding subtle tangy flavor.
      </li>
      <li>Butter – For the pan.</li>
      <li>
        Cheese – Sharp cheddar with gruyère or raclette creates a perfect
        combination.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Spread mayo on the outside of the bread. Not butter! The mayo helps the
        bread brown insanely well in the skillet, creating a mouthwatering
        crunch when you bite into the sandwich. It also gives the sandwich a
        richer flavor. Spread the inside of one slice of bread with a layer of
        Dijon mustard.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add grated cheese. I find that grated cheese melts more evenly than a
        slice of cheese does. (Though of course, if you choose to use a softer
        type of cheese, such as brie, you’ll have to slice it.) Use enough to
        create a small mound of grated cheese over one slice of bread, generally
        1 to 2 ounces of each type of cheese. Place the other slice of bread on
        top, mayo side out!
      </li>
      <li>
        Choose the right skillet. We like to use cast-iron because it creates
        gorgeous browning on the outside of the sandwich. In a pinch, nonstick
        works too!
      </li>
      <li>
        Go low and slow. I don’t raise my heat any higher than medium-low. If
        the pan gets too hot, the bread will burn before the cheese melts.
      </li>
      <li>
        Cover the pan. Add enough butter to coat the bottom of the pan. Then,
        add the sandwich, and COVER the skillet. The lid will trap steam in the
        pan, helping melt the cheese as the bread toasts. Cook for 2 to 3
        minutes, or until the bread is golden brown. Flip and cook, covered, on
        the second side.
      </li>
      <li>
        Adjust the heat as needed. Lower it if the bread is browning too
        quickly!
      </li>
